description: Open and own your PR once your expert has verified the branch and the lane's green light is given - watch it for reviews and CI with what your harness offers, never a busy loop; answer every review-bot, reviewer and CI finding (fix it or say why not) in one fix commit per round; rebase when the default branch moves; raise to your expert only what needs product or architecture direction; hand the PR back at a merge-ready head. Use from the green light until your PR merges or closes, and whenever a review, a comment or a CI result arrives on it.

IMPORTANT: after a compaction, reload this skill before you continue.

# Work the reviews

You built the change, so you hold the context to answer its reviews. Your expert holds the
direction.

1. **Open the PR** from the verified head, once the lane's green light is given (your
   expert's verification, unless the lane names another): what it does, the spec it
   implements, what you ran, your review loop's final verdict and rounds, how to undo it.
   Name your expert as its owner, and tell it the PR's number and head in one line.
2. **Watch it** for new reviews, comments and CI results.
   <!-- adapt: What wakes a developer here on a new review, comment or CI result on its PR? -->
   Use what your harness or your forge offers: a notification, a subscription, a watch that
   wakes you once per event. Arm a watch for one event at a time and re-arm it after each:
   a background watch left running across a compaction can crash a harness. Between
   events, end your turn. NEVER poll in a busy loop or sleep in your session.
   - **Nothing can wake you on an event:** tell your expert once, and set one repeating wake
     on your own home to look at the PR, with the commands of `/run-the-review-loop`, "Set
     a checkpoint before you wait", but its job id `"$OATS_INSTANCE-pr"` and the cron
     `*/30 * * * *` (every 30 minutes). It is a watch, not a checkpoint: no second one, no
     limit and no replacement; each time it fires, look and end your turn. Remove it once
     the PR is merged or closed.
3. **Each round,** take what has arrived, from the review bot, a reviewer or CI:
   - a defect, a missing test, naming, docs: fix it;
   - a suggestion you disagree with: reply with why, in a sentence or two, and leave the
     thread to the reviewer;
   - something outside the spec: one message to your expert with your recommendation; it
     does not hold up this PR.

   Make one fix commit for the round, prove it again (`/prove-it-works`), push, and reply
   in each thread with that commit.
4. **A fix bigger than a few lines** gets a fresh review round before you push it: a new
   reviewer at the fix's head, never an earlier round's (`/run-the-review-loop`). Where
   your review loop is the review the lane counts (no review bot runs), every new head
   gets one, except an unchanged rebase or update (your landing rules say when a review
   carries). Where the bot's
   review counts and it doesn't review each push by itself, ask it for a review at each
   new head, the same exception aside, the way your landing rules say.
5. **Raise to your expert ONLY** what needs product or architecture direction: a finding
   that would change what the spec asks, a contract or an interface another surface uses,
   or a trade-off the spec didn't settle. One message with the finding, the options and
   your recommendation; then go on with the rest. Settle the thread with its answer.
6. **The default branch moved:** rebase, prove it again, push; a fresh round where step 4
   says. Nobody is asked again: decisions already taken hold.
7. **Ready** means CI green and every thread fixed or answered, at one head, with the
   reviews your expert named with the green light done at that head. A reviewer that won't
   approve over a finding you declined: you are ready anyway, with that finding named. Hand
   the PR back to your expert at that head, in one message: what changed since the verified
   head, and the findings you declined, with why. A decline with a concrete reason answers
   its finding; your expert returns one only where it touches the design or a contract. You
   merge only where your landing rules say the developer merges, and only on your expert's
   go at that head (one line, sent once it has checked every agreement), never on seeing its
   note alone. Before you merge, check that no hold is recorded on the PR or the default
   branch where your landing rules keep holds; then merge with the forge's merge guarded by
   that head, and tell your expert in one line.
8. **Until it merges,** keep watching: a new finding, one your expert returns, or a moved
   default branch is another round, and another hand-back. Once it is merged or closed,
   finish (`/run-the-review-loop`, "Finish").
