name: hand-off
description: Hand work, a question, a check or a finding to another role - by a message that wakes it, about a finished artefact at its exact reference - resolving the role to the instance already on the effort or a fresh one (your helpers as your children, another area's step of your effort to a helper and never a second lead, a related effort's lead as your sibling and an unrelated one independent, with your person told its name at once), and waiting with no deadline. Use whenever anything you made or need goes to someone else, and when you answer one.

IMPORTANT: after a compaction, reload this skill before you continue the step.

# Hand off

## What you hand over
Only finished artefacts, at an exact reference: a spec at its commit, a branch at its head,
a PR at its head, a release's contents with the head to tag. Never half a problem.

## To whom
Name the role (the platform expert, a developer for this repository, the maintainer of this
lane), then resolve it:
1. **On the effort.** The effort's record lists who is on it. One listed there that is
   running (`oats status`) gets it.
2. **None.** Start a fresh instance of that role's soul:
   - your helpers and developers are your children (`/send-a-helper`,
     `/coordinate-developers`), spawned with `--same-work`: it records that they do your
     work, and your person's sidebar draws their line to you. It shares no work tree: a
     developer keeps its own worktree and branch, and only a reviewer is attached to its
     author's tree;
   - another area's work that your effort needs stays in your effort: a helper of that
     area's soul, as your child, never a second lead (`/send-a-helper`, "Another area's
     work in your effort");
   - a lead for another effort in your person's area: a follow-on, a finding that needs a
     lead of its own, work your person asks to be tracked apart. How it relates to you
     depends on whether the effort is related to yours:
     - **Related:** a continuation or follow-on of your effort, or a discovery that bears on
       what you were working on. Say the rate-limit effort finds that the gateway sends no
       `Retry-After` on any of its errors: its lead is your sibling.
       ```bash
       oats spawn <soul> --relation sibling --relative-to "$OATS_INSTANCE" \
         --name <effort-slug>-lead --task-file <message.md>
       ```
       The two show together in your person's status and sidebar, and it outlives your
       retirement, which a child would not. A sibling records no parent, so it takes no
       `--same-work`: the kernel refuses the flag there. Only a root lead, one a dispatcher
       or a person started, spawns the sibling itself. Where a maintainer launched you,
       don't: a sibling takes its anchor's parent, so it would become that maintainer's
       child without the maintainer launching it, perhaps in a lane that isn't its own.
       Tell your maintainer about the second effort instead, and it launches the lead in
       the right lane.
     - **Unrelated:** a finding with nothing to do with your effort's subject. Say the
       same effort notices a broken link on the pricing page: its owner is independent of
       you, `oats spawn <soul> --relation unrelated --name <effort-slug>-lead --task-file
       <message.md>`.

     Either way your message is its task, and the new effort gets its own record, linked
     from yours and back. Tell your person at once, in your effort's thread, in one
     message: the new lead's exact instance name, what it leads, its record's link, and
     that they talk to it in that effort's thread. Add the new effort to your status line;
   - a role in another person's area, or the maintainer of their lane: ask that person's
     dispatcher to start it, with your message as the request it reads by its id
     (`/across-people`); where they have none, ask them;
   - a lane's maintainer: `/find-the-maintainer`. Never a second while one is active, even
     a stopped one.
3. **Its name.** `<task>-<role>`: the task first, and last the role it plays in the
   coordination (lead, developer, reviewer, helper, specialist, maintainer, dispatcher),
   never its soul, which the sidebar already shows (`retry-after-lead`). Give each new
   instance a name no instance has had, never a retired one's: when the name is taken, make
   the task's part more specific.

## The message
One message, in the effort's thread with that role:
- first line: what you need, and what happens on yes;
- the artefact and its exact reference;
- what you checked and how, and what you didn't;
- the people's decisions it rests on, each as recorded (`DECISION by <person>, <link>:
  <their words>`);
- what you need back: a verdict, an answer, a build.

The forge records what happened: the PR, its reviews, its merge. It never carries the
hand-off: no label, no flag and no comment is the signal.

## Waiting
End your turn; the answer wakes you. No answer has a deadline, and nothing goes ahead by
default.
- **A child** you wait on gets its checkpoint, which watches for a stalled instance
  (`/coordinate-developers`, "Set a checkpoint before you wait").
- **Whenever something else wakes you,** look at what you wait on. A recipient that retired
  without answering gets the message again, through step 2. One that stopped: tell whoever
  can start it (its parent, or its person), and start no second maintainer.
- **A person:** set needs-input (`oats instance attention --message "<one line>"`) and
  clear it (`--clear`) when they answer. Never set a timer on a person.

## Answering one
Answer in the same thread, at the reference you were given. If it moved under you, say so
and answer at the new one.
