description: Find the maintainer a lane's landing rules need - the lane your work is in, the person who owns it, their active maintainer there on the lane map (running or stopped), or have one started for them when they have none, never a second while one is active. Use when a landing rule needs a maintainer's read, merge, release or direction answer, or when anyone asks you to bring a lane's maintainer in.

# Find the maintainer

A maintainer is called by message at an exact reference, where a lane's landing rules need
its read (of a PR, or of a contract change before it is built) or reserve its merge. It is
never a station every change passes, and you look for one only then.

1. **The lane** your work is in, from your landing rules; for a release, the release lane
   they name. When you can't tell, ask your person; meanwhile plan and build, but call and
   start no maintainer.
2. **Whose lane:** the person who owns it, from your landing rules' ownership record. With
   one person, it is yours.
3. **Their maintainer there:** the lane map's `active` entry for that person in that lane,
   with your messaging layer's presence (its roster; without one, the entry alone).
   - **Running:** hand it the PR at its head, or the question at its commit (`/hand-off`).
   - **`active` but not running:** message it anyway (messages wait), and tell its person it
     is stopped, so they can start it. An entry not updated for two weeks: ask its person
     whether it was retired; only they, or the map's keeper on their word, mark it `left`.
   - **None, or `left`:** have the needed one started for that person. For your own person,
     spawn your workspace's maintainer soul for them, independent of you and never as your
     child, so your retirement can't stop it:
     ```bash
     oats spawn <maintainer soul> --relation unrelated --purpose <person>-<lane>-<n> --task-file <brief.md>
     ```
     `<n>` is one more than the number of earlier maintainers for that person and lane (the
     map's `left` entries), so no instance takes a retired one's name. Brief: "maintainer
     for <person> in <lane>; first call: <your instance> asks for <a read | the merge> of
     <PR> at <head>" (or "<the release> of <what goes in> at <head>"), and where the lane
     map is. Tell your person its instance name, and that they retire it with
     `oats retire <name>`. For another person, ask their dispatcher to start it with that
     brief as its task; where they have none, ask them (`/across-people`). If your workspace
     names no maintainer soul, ask your person and spawn none.
4. **No lane map:**
   - **Your landing rules link none** (a copy adapted without one): the lane owner has no
     maintainer on record. Go on as in step 3, "None, or `left`": the maintainer started
     creates the map in your tasks layer and adds its entry. Send its link to whoever keeps
     your landing rules (`/findings-and-blocks`), so it is written there.
   - **They link a map you can't read:** that is a block (`/findings-and-blocks`). Start no
     maintainer until you can read it: you couldn't tell whether one is active.

Never a second maintainer for a lane while one is active, even a stopped one. Call one
maintainer, the lane owner's, never all of them.
