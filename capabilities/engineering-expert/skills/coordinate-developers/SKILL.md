name: coordinate-developers
description: Launch and drive developers to build what you specified, for each spec whose builder is a developer (plan-and-spec, Who builds it), one per surface, several in parallel when surfaces are independent. Use when a spec a developer builds is ready, when choosing how many developers to run, when a developer asks a question or returns work, or when work must be re-assigned.

# Coordinate developers

## Launch
- A developer builds a spec only where `/plan-and-spec` ("Who builds it") gives it one: the
  build would crowd your context, surfaces can be built in parallel, or the surface needs
  a specialist in a lane of its own. Otherwise you build it yourself, as that section
  says.
- One developer per surface; two surfaces, two developers, in parallel if the plan allows.
  Never one developer for two unrelated surfaces, and never one coupled change split
  across agents: a change and its tests have one author.
<!-- adapt: Which developer souls exist, and which environment does each provide? -->
- Spawn the developer soul for the surface (your workspace's default one, or the one whose
  environment the surface needs) as your child, the spec as its task:
  ```bash
  oats spawn <developer-soul> --parent <your instance> --same-work \
    --name <piece-slug>-developer --task-file <spec.md>
  ```
  Name it for the piece it builds, with its role last (`gateway-limits-developer`), and
  with a name no instance has had: when the name is taken, make the piece's part more
  specific.
  The spec's "Surface / files" names its repository. Where that is the developer soul's own
  repository, leave out `--repo` and `--base`: the worktree starts at the commit the spawn
  observed on the remote. Where it is another repository, add
  `--repo <clone of the spec's repository> --base origin/<its default branch>`. `--base`
  names a ref in the clone, read there and never fetched: a bare branch name is the clone's
  local branch, however far behind, and `origin/<branch>` is as fresh as the clone's last
  fetch. Add only what the spec can't hold: the branch or PR to target, and who else works
  next to it.
- Before you apply, preview the same command with `--preview` and check its start point,
  `from <ref or repository>@<commit>`, against the remote:
  `git -C <clone> ls-remote origin <its default branch>`. If they differ, don't apply. For
  the soul's own repository the remote moved since the preview: preview again. For
  another, the clone is behind: update its `origin/<its default branch>`, then preview
  again. Name the destination, so the fetch updates that ref whatever branches the clone
  tracks:
  `git -C <clone> fetch origin refs/heads/<branch>:refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`, with
  `<branch>` its default branch.
- `--same-work` records that the developer does your work, and your person's sidebar draws
  its line to you. It shares no work tree: the developer keeps its own worktree and
  branch, and only a reviewer is attached to its author's tree. A developer you started
  before the flag existed gets it with `oats instance same-work <developer> on`.
- Tell each developer which developers share an interface with it, so they talk directly.
- Record each in your instance state: instance name, surface, spec, branch.

## While they work
- Answer questions quickly. If one reveals a hole in the spec, fix the spec and tell
  everyone it affects.
- The spec fixes what and the constraints; the developer chooses how (including whether to
  parallelize).
- Watch the interfaces; when two developers disagree about a shared shape, you decide.

## Set a checkpoint before you wait
Once your turn ends you run no instructions, and a stalled child may report nothing: a
refused provider, a stuck harness or a sign-in screen can each leave it `running`, with no
claim and no new event. So before you end your turn to wait on a child, set a wake that
fires from outside your session, one per child, each time you hand it something. From your
home:
```bash
oats session inspect --home "$OATS_INSTANCE_HOME" --json   # wakeHold: see below
node -e 'const d=new Date(Date.now()+240*60000);console.log(d.getUTCMinutes(),d.getUTCHours(),d.getUTCDay())'
cat > checkpoint-<slug>.json <<EOF
{"kind":"wake","enabled":true,"cron":"<minute> <hour> * * *","tz":"UTC","home":"$OATS_INSTANCE_HOME",
 "message":"Checkpoint: <child> owes <result>. If it came, remove this job and stop; if not, follow 'Set a checkpoint before you wait' in /coordinate-developers."}
EOF
oats schedule add "$OATS_INSTANCE-<slug>" --file checkpoint-<slug>.json
oats schedule show "$OATS_INSTANCE-<slug>" --json   # nextRun must be the moment you meant
```
- **Read `wakeHold` first.** A wake's Enter answers whatever your session is showing. Set
  one only where it reads `on-claims` or `not-exposed`. With `unknown` or no `wakeHold`, set none: hand the wait to your
  parent in one line (who owes what, by when), and it sets the checkpoint on its own home.
  When that one is due, your parent tells you so: follow "When it fires" below, taking its
  first message as your first checkpoint and its second as your second. With no parent,
  say in the effort's status line that nothing bounds this wait.
- **A developer hands you its wait** on its reviewer: set a checkpoint on that developer,
  on your home, naming that reviewer and head in its message. It watches the developer,
  never its reviewer: inspecting and replacing a reviewer is the developer's. When it
  fires and the developer still waits on that reviewer, the developer's own checkpoint is
  due, and that is no "waits on someone else" below: tell the developer in one line ("your
  checkpoint on <reviewer> at <head> is due: follow 'When it fires' in
  /run-the-review-loop") and set the next one half as far out, its message starting
  "Second checkpoint:". When that one fires, your line says "second checkpoint", and the
  developer's skill ends its wait. A developer that neither moves nor answers your line is
  stalled itself: the list below applies to it. If you can't set one either, hand it up
  the same way.
- **The 240 is the minutes until the result is overdue:** your plan's estimate, with margin.
  Past a day, put the weekday it prints in the last cron field.
- **The cron repeats on purpose.** A minute the host slept through is never replayed, so a
  pinned date would stay silent for a year; this one comes round again.
- **When the result arrives,** remove the job: `oats schedule remove
  "$OATS_INSTANCE-<slug>"`. If that refuses because the job is running, the wake started
  your stopped session: add `--force`, which stops nothing.
- **To set a later checkpoint,** remove the job the same way and run the recipe again: `add`
  refuses an id that exists. A second one's message starts "Second checkpoint:", so the wake
  says which one this is, even after a restart.
- **No wake can fire** unless `oats schedule add` succeeds and `oats schedule host status`
  answers `active: true`, `registered: true` and no `problems`. Failing that, tell your
  parent once, in one line: its own checkpoint on you then bounds this step. With no
  parent, say so in the effort's status line. Installing the host's timer is the
  operator's.
- **`E_SCHEDULER_BUSY`** may be a tick holding the lock, and nothing changed: run the
  command once more a little later. Still busy, no wake can be set: tell your parent, as
  above. That lock is never yours to remove.

**When it fires,** the result is overdue, nothing more: a reason to look, not proof the
child failed, and no reason to interrupt one that is working. Read its row in `oats status
--json`, `oats instance events <child> --json` (`waitingClaims`) and `oats instance git
<child>` (the branch head and its time), then:
- **A result or question reached you and you missed it:** act on it.
- **A claim says what it needs:** give it.
- **A `wake-held` event:** history, not a state. Read the job it names: `oats schedule show
  <schedule> --json`. Only a `lastRun` that still carries `held` means its wake is waiting,
  and then someone outside it has to act: tell your parent (with none, your person). Never
  clear the claim or answer the dialog yourself: a claim can be stale, but a live dialog
  takes the next Enter.
- **The result moved** (new commits on its branch, a new PR, a new review, comment or CI
  run on its PR, or its reply naming what it waits on): set a later first checkpoint. A
  start, a claim or a lifecycle event is not movement.
- **It waits on someone else** (a reviewer, a person, another lane) and says so: it is not
  stalled, and no wait on an answer ends by time. A wait it handed you is the exception
  ("A developer hands you its wait", above). Set a later first checkpoint, never a
  second one on that account.
- **`running` is false, `sessionEnd` `exited`:** it ended by itself. Start it again with
  `oats session start --home <home>`, and set a second checkpoint.
- **`running` is false, `sessionEnd` `lost`:** add `--resume` to that start, and set a
  second checkpoint.
- **`running` is false, `sessionEnd` `stopped`, or none:** it may have been stopped on
  purpose. Don't start it: ask your parent (with none, your person) whether it should run.
- **A claim says its turn failed, or nothing shows:** `running` with no claim says nothing
  either way. Ask it one precise question through your messaging layer, which also gives a
  failed turn a new start, and set a second checkpoint, half as far out.

**A second overdue checkpoint with no movement ends the wait:** the child neither moved nor
answered. Never set a third on a child whose result hasn't moved. Check
`oats retire <child> --plan` and retire it: a work tree holding work is kept, but the
child's own children are only stopped and move to you, and their wakes would start them
again, so retire each of those too, the same way. Then hand the spec and what the branches
hold to a new child, and tell your parent. Don't stop a child instead: a stopped home's
pending wake starts it again.

## When work comes back
- A developer reports when its review loop has converged: a round with a fresh reviewer
  found nothing to fix. Don't act on intermediate heads. The developer iterates with the
  reviewers, not you: never run review rounds or spawn reviewers for its work.
- Verify it once (`/verify-developer-work`), then accept it or return it. A return goes
  back to the same developer, which fixes it and runs its loop again with fresh reviewers.
- Accepted work: give the developer the lane's green light at the verified head. It opens
  the PR and works its reviews, raising to you only what needs product or architecture
  direction; you land it (`/land-on-agreement`).
- Once that PR is merged and green, or closed, and the developer sends its done line,
  retire it without asking anyone (`/land-on-agreement`, "Retire what's finished"). A
  hand-back isn't finished: the developer may still be needed for fixes and rebases.
