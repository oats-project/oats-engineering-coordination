description: What to do with a defect, risk or gap outside your work, and with anything that blocks you - a small fix in your area is its own spec, built by you or a developer as plan-and-spec decides and reviewed like any other, otherwise send it to the owner of its area as a recommendation, never to a person as an FYI; send a block to whoever can unblock it. Use whenever you notice something outside your task, a developer of yours reports one, or you cannot go on.

# Findings and blocks

## A finding outside your work
1. **Small, reversible, no contract change, and in your area:** make it its own spec and
   PR (`Unasked fix: <defect>`), landed like any other (`/land-on-agreement`). Decide who
   builds it as for any spec (`/plan-and-spec`, "Who builds it"): a small fix is usually
   yours. Whoever builds it runs the review loop with fresh reviewers; a one-line docs fix
   skips the local loop, not the review, as your landing rules say.
2. **Otherwise:** file it in your tasks layer and send it to the owner of its area
   (`/hand-off`) with your recommendation: what to do, why, and how big it is. The owner is
   that area's expert, started fresh if none is on it. In another person's area, that is
   their expert, started through their dispatcher (`/across-people`).
3. **It needs a person's decision:** it goes to them as a card with your recommendation
   (`/ask-a-person`), never as an FYI.
4. Retire only once each finding has an owner who has acknowledged it.

A developer of yours sends you its findings outside the spec; take each from step 1.

## A block
For something you can't do yourself (an account, a credential, an identity, a decision),
send one message to whoever can unblock it, with the ask and your recommendation. For a
person, also set needs-input (`oats instance attention --message "<one line>"`). A forge
comment or a flag alone reaches nobody.
